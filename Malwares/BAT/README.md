A bunch of malicious software i built or Found while hunting.
For these...:

    ðŸ‘‰ Save the file in the startup folder for maximum impact
    ðŸ‘‰ Dont deploy on your main machine; Use VM or throwaway machine
    ðŸ‘‰ Some of these are detectable with AVs
    ðŸ‘‰ I didnt obfuscate the code since the malware is for educational purposes only
