    Trickbot is computer malware, a trojan for the Microsoft Windows and other operating systems, and the cybercrime group behind this. 
    Its major function was originally the theft of banking details and other credentials, 
    but its operators have extended its capabilities to create a complete modular malware ecosystem.
