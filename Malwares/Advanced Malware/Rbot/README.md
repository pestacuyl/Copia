Backdoor:W32/RBot is a large family of backdoors - remote administration utility program that, once installed on a computer, allows a user access and control it over a network or the Internet. When used maliciously, these programs allow a remote attacker to control the infected computer, usually without the knowledge or consent of the system's main user(s).

A remote attacker may use the backdoor to perform a variety of actions, such as stealing data, executing commands on the affected machine or accessing other machines on a local network.
