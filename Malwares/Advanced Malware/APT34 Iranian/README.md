The group has reportedly been active since at least 2014. It has targeted many of the same organizations as Advanced Persistent Threat, according to John Hultquist.

In April 2019, APT34's cyber-espionage tools' source code was leaked through Telegram. The group has reportedly targeted organizations in the financial, energy, telecommunications, and chemical industries, as well as critical infrastructure systems. APT34 reportedly uses Microsoft Excel macros, PowerShell-based exploits and social engineering to gain access to its targets. 

Since the 2019 leak of APT34’s tools by an entity named “Lab Dookhtegan”, the threat group has been actively retooling and updating their payload arsenal to try and avoid detection, creating several different malware variants whose ultimate purpose remained the same: to gain the initial foothold on the targeted device. Iran backed APT34 shows no sign of slowing down, further pushing its political agenda in the middle-east, with an ongoing focus on Lebanon – using offensive cyber operations.

While maintaining its modus operandi and reusing old techniques, as reviewed above, the group continues to create new and updated tools to minimize the possible detection of their tools by security vendors.
