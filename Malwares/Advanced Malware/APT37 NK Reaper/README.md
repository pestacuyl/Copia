APT37’s recent activity reveals that the group’s operations are expanding in scope and sophistication, with a toolset that includes access to zero-day vulnerabilities and wiper malware. We assess with high confidence that this activity is carried out on behalf of the North Korean government given malware development artifacts and targeting that aligns with North Korean state interests. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence believes that APT37 is aligned with the activity publicly reported as Scarcruft and Group123.

Goldbackdoor is the last malware used by APT37 (aka Ricochet Collima, InkySquid, Reaper and ScarCruft) in a cyber espionage operation against journalists. It has been discovered by Stairwell cybersecurity experts. The North Korea’s APT attempted to impersonate NK News and distributed the new malware with spear-phishing campaigns targeting journalists who specialize in the DPRK. These messages were sent from the personal email of a former director of South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS), previously compromised by the malicious hackers. Moreover, researchers assess with medium-high confidence that GOLDBACKDOOR is the successor of, or used in parallel with, the malware BLUELIGHT, also attributed to APT37.
