## Duqu 2.0
Powerful strain of the notorious Duqu malware appeared in the wild after going dark in 2012. 
Duqu 2.0 was the malicious agent used against the security firm and many other targets worldwide.
Described by security researchers as highly sophisticated malware that exploited a number of zero-days vulnerabilities, which are listed below:

    CVE-2015-2360;
    CVE-2014-4148;
    CVE-2014-6324;

Malware researchers at Kaspersky that first detected it revealed that among its targets there were entities linked to the negotiations about Iranâ€™s nuclear deal and IT security firms. Duqu 2.0 targeted a number of Western organizations and entities operating Asia and in the Middle East.

### victims of Duqu 2.0

Duqu 2.0 has been used to attack a complex range of targets at the highest levels with similarly varied geo-political interests. Victims have been found in Western countries, as well as in countries in the Middle East and Asia. Duqu is on the lookout for data that could be used in a cyber-attack on industrial control systems. The known components are attempting to gather information, not to be damaging. However, due to Duqu's modular nature, a specific payload might be used to attack any type of computer system by any method, potentially allowing for cyber-physical attacks.

However, its use on personal computer systems has been discovered to destroy all recent information input on the system and the entire hard disk in some situations. Symantec has examined Duqu's internal communications, but the specific technique by which it replicates inside an infected network is unknown.
Duqu 2.0 Targeted Attacks. Duqu 2.0 makes use of advanced evasive strategies. It is difficult to detect because it is stored in memory. Duqu's updated version no longer writes data to the victim's hard drive. According to Symantec experts, Duqu 2.0 has two variants: one is a backdoor that appears to be used to gain persistence in the targeted entity by infecting multiple computers, and the second variant reflects its development and has more advanced capabilities.
