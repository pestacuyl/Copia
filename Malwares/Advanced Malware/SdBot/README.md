### Installation

Based on the variant, SdBot backdoors copy themselves either to the Windows System directory, or to other directories located in the System directory. It also ensures the copy is started when the system stars by creating a subkey in one of the following registry keys:

    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

The name of subkey and its value differ depending on the variant.

### Activity

SdBot backdoors connect to various IRC servers, joining an IRC channel (the choice of channel is hardcoded into the code) in order to receive instruction from the hacker. The backdoor can perform a variety of actions, including acting as an IRC proxy server, downloading and executing remote files, sending messages and more.
