Mirai is a malware that turns networked devices running Linux into remotely controlled bots that can be used as part of a botnet in large-scale network attacks. Mirai is a type of malware that targets consumer devices like smart cameras and home routers, turning them into a zombie network of remote controlled bots. Mirai botnets are used by cybercriminals to target computer systems in massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. The Mirai botnet was first found in August 2016 by MalwareMustDie, a white hat malware research group, and has been used in some of the largest and most disruptive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, including an attack on 20 September 2016 on computer security journalist Brian Krebs' web site, an attack on French web host OVH, and the October 2016 Dyn cyberattack. Mirai was named after the 2011 TV anime series Mirai Nikki.

## Infection
First, Mirai malware scans IP addresses to identify smart devices running a version of Linux known as ARC. Then, Mirai exploits security vulnerabilities in the IoT device to gain network access via default username and password combinations. If these settings haven’t been changed or updated, Mirai can log in to the device and infect it with malware.

As the number of devices caught in the infected network mount, the cybercriminals in control then use the Mirai botnets to crash targeted websites or servers by bombarding it with more traffic that it can handle. The site or service will remain inaccessible to normal users until the DDoS attack is resolved, which increasingly involves the payment of a ransom.

Once Mirai has infected a smart device, it turns it into another zombie in an army of remotely controlled bots. Mirai will even purge any pre-existing malware to ensure the device is securely locked into the botnet — all without the consent or knowledge of the owner.

Under the control of the botnet creator, IoT hardware can then be forced to scan networks for other vulnerable devices to exploit, ensnaring yet more victims in the Mirai botnet. And since most smart homes are not equipped with comprehensive network security, smart devices remain vulnerable to Mirai and other IoT botnets.

## Who is under threat
Most devices that the Mirai botnet attacks are home routers and cameras, but almost any smart device is susceptible to IoT botnets. The same network connection that gives robot vacuums, IP intercoms, kitchen appliances, and smart vehicles their functionality in a smart home is also a potential backdoor for malware.

There are some parts of the IoT which are impervious to Mirai, but this is because the malware’s creators programmed their code not to attack certain IP addresses, such as those owned by the US Department of Defense.

## Why so Dangerous and feared.
Mirai botnets are particularly dangerous because they’re used in DDoS attacks, which can be commercially devastating and extremely difficult to stop. DDoS attacks have forced businesses to cough up large ransoms in several high-profile cases.
In addition to DDoS attacks, IoT botnets can hold devices hostage with ransomware, spread spam emails, and perpetrate click-fraud to harvest personal data and sensitive financial information...
