# Gozi Malware Family
### Also known as RM3, ISFB, Ursnif, Dreambot, CRM, Paprak and Snifula, 
Gozi can be considered as a group of malware families which are based on the same malicious codebase. Historically, it has been known as one of the most widely spread and longest-standing Banking Trojans with more than 14 years of activity. Its unique modular architecture facilitates multiple Threat Actors (TAs) in carrying on with their own malicious purposes, which in most cases are included in the following categories:

    - Banking fraud
    - eCommerce fraud
    - POS devices compromise
    - Ransomware 

Since its code was leaked in 2015, tracking all the different variants appears to be knotty and time consuming due to its fragmentation and the several distinct names used by security firms and researchers.The main functionalities of Gozi families, and derivatives, include:

    * Acting as info-stealer by collecting system activities and data (including network and browser data)
    * Recording keystrokes (keylogging)
    * Recording videos or making screenshots
    * Performing MitB (Man in the browser) attacks on the targeted websites (e.g., Formgrabbing, Web-injects)
    * Redirect browser navigation to malicious websites
    * Enabling hVNC (hidden-VNC) and SOCKS proxy 

Focusing on the Banking fraud category, during the last 2 years we were able to analyze in-depth a specific TA (or a group of affiliates) which distributes Gozi infections on EU territory to corporate banks and their customers. During our analysis, we were able to extract multiple TTPs on how this specific TA leverages Gozi to execute unauthorized transactions to a well-organized network of bank mule accounts controlled by the same group.
