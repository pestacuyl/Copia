# Equation Group: The USA's Deadly Army of Hackers
    Classified as an advanced persistent threatü•∂ 
    a highly sophisticated threat actor suspected of being tied to the Tailored Access Operations(TOC) unit of the 
    United States National Security Agency (NSA)  
    The name originated from the group's extensive use of encryption. 
    By 2015, Kaspersky documented 500 malware infections by the group in at least 42 countries ü•µ 
    while acknowledging that the actual number could be in the tens of thousands due to its self-terminating protocolüòµ

Kaspersky Labs describes it as one of the most sophisticated cyber attack groups in the world and "the most advanced we have seen", operating alongside the creators of Stuxnet and Flame. Most of their targets have been in; 

        Iran, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Syria, and Mali üßê 
A hacking group calling itself "The Shadow Brokers" announced that it had stolen malware code from the Equation Group. Kaspersky Lab noticed similarities between the stolen code and earlier known code from the Equation Group malware samples it had in its possession including quirks unique to the Equation Group's way of implementing the RC6 encryption algorithm, and therefore concluded that this announcement is legitimate.
