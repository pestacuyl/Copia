# OlympicDestroyer
    From these platforms(pyeongchang2018.com, network servers of the ski resorts & servers of Atos, the IT service provider), 
    the worm was automatically propagated in the network through Windows network shares. 
    Along the way it stole passwords saved on infected computers, 
    wrote them into itself and used them for subsequent propagation. 
    The ultimate objective of the Olympic Destroyer was;
    to purge files from network drives that the worm could reach and shut down the systems it infected.

Malware that was used by Sandworm Team against the 2018 Winter Olympics, held in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The main purpose of the malware was to render infected computer systems inoperable. The malware leverages various native Windows utilities and API calls to carry out its destructive tasks. 
Olympic Destroyer has worm-like features to spread itself across a computer network in order to maximize its destructive impact.

    As a result of the attack, malware dubbed the Olympic Destroyer took down the official Olympics website and Wi-Fi at the stadium 
    as well as affecting broadcasts of the event. 
    The Organizing Committee gave assurances that there would be no serious consequences, but the uproar was no laughing matter
