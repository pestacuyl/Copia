    - Triton is malware first discovered at a Saudi Arabian petrochemical plant in 2017. 
    - It can disable safety instrumented systems, which can then contribute to a plant disaster. 
    - In 2018, FireEye, a company that researches cyber-security, reported that the malware most likely came from:
            ---The Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics (CNIIHM)--- 
    a research entity in Russia.

    It has been called:
    "the world's most murderous malware."

In 2018, it was reported that the safety systems of a power station, believed to be in Saudi Arabia, were compromised when the Triconex industrial safety technology made by Schneider Electric SE was targeted in what is believed to have been a state sponsored attack. 
The computer security company Symantec claimed that the malware, known as "Triton", 
exploited a vulnerability in Windows operating systems.
