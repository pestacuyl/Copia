After the worm's file is run it goes through the polymorphic decryptor and then proceeds to the static part of the code that allocates a memory buffer and extracts the main worm's code into it. Then the control is passed directly to the extracted worm's code.

After getting control, the worm creates a few threads. One thread scans for vulnerable computers (on TCP ports 139 and 445) and sends exploits there in order to infect them.

The other thread scans for .HTM and .HTML files on all local hard disks and infects them by prepending a reference to worm's CLSID there.

## Infection

The worm copies itself multiple times to a hard drive and also affects HTML files.

The worm's file is polymorphically encrypted, which means every copy of the worm is different. The only constant aspect of the worm's code is the size of its executable file - 57856 bytes.

The worm creates a different CLSID for every copy of itself that it creates on the hard drive. The number of these copies can be quite large. The names of the worm's files are random. For example:

    bzehxvnz.exe
    hwexrtne.exe
    jbnshhqj.exe
    jjlenkbt.exe
    tsbjbtvn.exe


## ==> TYPE:           
            Net-Worm:W32/Allaple.A

## ==> Modus Operandi:  
            After getting control, the worm creates a few threads. One thread scans for vulnerable computers (on TCP ports 139 and 445) and sends exploits there in order to infect them. The other thread scans for .HTM and .HTML files on all local hard disks and infects them by prepending a reference to worm's CLSID there. One of the remaining threads performs a DoS attack on three websites located in Estonia. The worm also tries to brute-force network share passwords by performing a dictionary attack on them. he following TCP ports used during the DoS attack: 22, 80, 97, 443

The following is the dictionary used to bruteforce networks:

## ==> Key Points and Mitigation:.
```
☣️Aliz worm is relatively easy to disinfect.☣️
💉Based on the settings of your AV (tested against windows defender), it will either move the file to the quarantine where it cannot spread or cause harm, or remove it.🩺
💊Companies can take steps to prevent infection, with software and AV updates being most important.
