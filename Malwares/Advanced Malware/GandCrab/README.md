# GandCrab
    For most of its short but destructive run, 
    GandCrab typically spread from one computer to the next via something known as an exploit kit. 
    Exploits are a form of cyberattack that takes advantage of weaknesses or vulnerabilities
    on a target system in order to gain unauthorized access to that system.

GandCrab is Malwarebytes' detection name for a family of ransomware that encrypts important files and asks for a ransom to decrypt them. There are several versions of Ransom. GandCrab as the threat actors keep working on it. They all target Windows systems.
