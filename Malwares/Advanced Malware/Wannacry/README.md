The WannaCry ransomware attack was a worldwide cyberattack in May 2017 by the WannaCry ransomware cryptoworm, which targeted computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system by encrypting data and demanding ransom payments in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. It propagated through ETERNALBLUE, an exploit developed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) for older Windows systems. EternalBlue was stolen and leaked by a group called The Shadow Brokers a month prior to the attack. While Microsoft had released patches previously to close the exploit, much of WannaCry's spread was from organizations that had not applied these, or were using older Windows systems that were past their end-of-life. These patches were imperative to organizations' cyber security but many were not implemented due to ignorance of their importance. Some have claimed a need for 24/7 operation, aversion to risking having formerly working applications breaking because of patch changes, lack of personnel or time to install them, or other reasons.

The attack was estimated to have affected more than 200,000 computers across 150 countries, with total damages ranging from hundreds of millions to billions of dollars. Security experts believed from preliminary evaluation of the worm that the attack originated from North Korea or agencies working for the country.

## HOW DOES IT WORK
![This is an image](wannacry.gif)

## ==> TYPE:           
            Ransomware Cryptoworm 

## ==> Modus Operandi:  
            Considered a network worm because it also includes a transport mechanism to automatically spread itself. This transport code scans for vulnerable systems, then uses the EternalBlue exploit to gain access, and the DoublePulsar tool to install and execute a copy of itself.

## ==> Language:        
            WannaCry versions 0, 1, and 2 were created using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0
            
## ==> Key Points and Mitigation:
```
☣️The WannaCry ransomware epidemic of 2017 disrupted hospitals, banks and communications companies worldwide☣️
💉Four years later, cybercriminals renewed efforts to deploy WannaCry ransomware during the COVID-19 pandemic.🩺
💊Companies can take steps to prevent infection, with software updates being most important.
