Recently, the Zscaler ThreatLabZ team came across a nasty piece of malware hosted on a fake MMS website called mmsprivate[.]site. The site lures victims with what seem to be private photos, inviting them to take a closer look. Upon accepting the offer, victims fall prey to a malicious Android Package (APK) that downloads onto their phones. The malware disguises itself as Сooбщениe, which translated to english means Messages, and performs its malicious functionality by exploiting Android AccessibilityService, which assists those with disabilities in using Android devices and apps. It then hides itself in order to spy on its victims.
