Dubbed TangleBot, the malware first appeared in September and once installed gains access to many different permissions required for eavesdropping on communications and stealing sensitive data, including the ability to monitor all user activity, use the camera, listen to audio, monitor the location of the device, and more. Currently, it's targeting users in the US and Canada. TangleBot provides the attackers with full control over the infected Android device, allowing them to monitor and record all user activity, including knowing websites visited, stealing usernames and passwords using a keylogger, while also allowing the attackers to record audio and video using the microphone and camera. The malware can also monitor data on the phone including messages and stored files, as well as monitoring the GPS location, allowing what researchers describe as a "full range of surveillance and collection capabilities".
