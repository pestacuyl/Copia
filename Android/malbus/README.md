Threat actors behind the MalBus campaign targeted legitimate developers of apps that already had a solid and deserved reputation. By compromising the developer accounts, the threat actors were able to add an additional library before uploading the updated app to Google Play. That library ran an update process during the app installation that downloaded and then dynamically loaded a malicious Trojan disguised as a media file with a .mov extension.

    "highly targeted, not only in terms of geography but also the type of data sought." 
    That data being military and political in nature, 
    demonstrating "the extended use of the mobile platform as a viable target for espionage campaigns.
    "A successful MalBus installation would index the user device directory structure and scan for keywords such as;
    "national defense, national intelligence service, military operation and defect," alongside a long list of others. 
    "This has been the focus of specific threat groups for well over a year now," said a scurity Researcher from Kaspersky in 2021.
