The threat actors behind Farseer, and related malware including HenBox, continue to grow their armoury with the addition of this previously-unknown malware family. The overlapping infrastructure, shared TTPs and similarities in malicious code and configurations highlights the web of threats used to target victims in and around the South East Asia region and perhaps beyond.Â 

    This particular file stands out because it shares certain similarities with the config resource used by HenBox. 
    In March 2018, Palo Alto Networks first discovered 
    this Android malware family masquerading as VPN and Android system apps in an effort to target Uyghurs, 
    a Turkic ethnic group consisting primarily of Muslims which lives in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in North West China. 

The security firm's researchers subsequently took a closer look at HenBox and found that it shares ties to infrastructure used in previous targeted attacks involving threats like PlugX, Zupdax, 9002 and Poison Ivy.
