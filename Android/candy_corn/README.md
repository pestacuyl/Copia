    Ferrara Candy, which produces 85 percent of the U.S.’s candy corn, was reportedly the victim of a ransomware attack earlier this month. 
    On Oct. 9, 2021 the confectionary saw some of its systems encrypted by malicious hackers. 
    The company worked with authorities to return to full operations. 
    Ferrara has released few specific details about the attack, and it’s unclear at this time which ransomware group is responsible. 
    One potential culprit is BlackMatter, a group that rose from the ashes of the former DarkSide ransomware gang 
    and who federal authorities warned is still on the offensive in 2022
